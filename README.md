The project contains basic operations on a Binary Search Tree.
The following operations are performed on a search tree.

1)Inserting an element in a binary search tree <br />
2)Deleting an element from a binary search tree <br />
3)Print inorder,preorder and postorder traversals of a binary search tree <br />
4)Generating a binary search tree using preorder traversal <br />
5)To search for a particualr key in the tree <br />
5)To return the minimum and maximum element in a BST <br />

The main file BST_operations.py has all the definitions and implementations of the various functions <br />
The test_operations.py file has a demo of one particular test case used to check the functionality of the operations <br />
